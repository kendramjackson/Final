<h1>Safety Wings Proposal</h1>
<p>Orginal plan:I would like to expand my health insurance calculator. My goal would be to make the insurance calculator work in a web page and then match patients with a plan to that would best fit there needs. 
    If they are uninsurable, then I would recommend an alternative or the next best option</p>
<p>Actual program: I did expand upon the health insurance calculator. I ended up giving the user information about a plan that would fit them and gave people who are uninsurable resources.</p>
<h2>Technology Overview </h2>
<p> I would be using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make my project</p>
